Given a video from the driver's view and a corresponding CSV with gaze location, the code will extract individual images based on the given time frames in the CSV. It will then crop these images based on a radius of focus, with the center being at the [x,y] coordinates of the driver's gaze. Lastly, computer vision classification will be used to classify these cropped images into the zones depicted in the image below and save this information into a few CSV file.
